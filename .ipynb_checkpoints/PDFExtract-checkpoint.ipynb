      " Page 4 of 8   8.0 Booster Heater Pilot Burner Modification   8.1 Overview During Outage 2020, pilot burner of BHs was replaced by new higher capacity continuously running pilot burner in order to run BH with lower steam flow requirement. This will help to evaporate the condensate inside U type steam tubes of BHs without much reddownstream header. Ultimately, it will save gas consumption in HTF-Hs which will be used in BH to generate electricity more efficiently. The old burner system includes an intermittent igniter. This igniter is brought into service following a purge cycle and is used to ignite main burner operation. Following main burner ignition, the igniter is removed from service. To accommodate the above mentioned requirement for low heat input stand-by service, a new larger igniter was retrofitted. It will be light off prior to main burner start. Logic in BH PLC were implemented to avoid the pilot burner operation continuously during main burner firing.  8.2 Logic Modifications  During the light-off sequence, rather than an automatic transfer from igniter operation to main burner operation, when the igniter is brought into service the BMS system will hold this condition giving indication of HOT STANDBY MODE. Air control devices should be held in minimum light-off positions. Following a 10 second delay, an option should be provided to site operators to TRANSFER TO MAIN BURNER. This option would continue the already programmed transition sequence to main burner operation. After this transition, the system will release to modulate per current logic. A flame scanner signal must be maintained during all modes or otherwise the system should initiate a trip. No automated adjustment of igniter heat input is included in the system. Rather, adjustment of igniter heat input will require mechanical adjustment of the igniter regulator spring setting.                             \n"

      "  2                  Message from General Manager    The major outage has a significant importance to the long term strategy of Shams plant and assets. The vast scope includes major overhaul and inspection of critical equipment such as  steam turbine, generator, booster heaters, HTF heaters, DCS upgrade and others. These are critical assets and equipment that impact the business of Shams directly, thus  of paramount importance to ensure its reliability, availability, and efficiency over its lifetime.    There were many factors that contributed to the success of major outage. Some of those were preparation and planning, procurement and contracting, vendors and contractors management. Shams team made great efforts to ensure all these factors successfully completed in a timely manner.    This was the first major outage in Shams history and we all had a big pressure to demonstrate our competency, high performance and timely completion of this goal. The total investment and the duration of the outage has added more pressure from a financial perspective.         Managing the engagement of over 400 people at site and over 191,000 work-man hours presented unparalleled safety and operational challenge. Additionally, the circumstances that was forced upon us due to COVID-19 with the panic around the world, uncertainties, and psychological impact on everyone; added greater challenges and pressure on everyone. I am proud to state that our HSE records were excellent, and that we successfully implemented all precautionary measures recommended. Since our people are our greatest asset, I am pleased to confirm that there was no single case of major HSE incident reported which is complementing our outstanding record of no LTI since January 2016.     All technical challenges, unexpected deficiencies, challenges of managing multiple contractors, difficulties handled successfully by Shams team. We were constantly facing much further delays that could have resulted in greater lost production. However, thankfully to our skilled team, I have a privilege to say that the complete scope was successfully completed and without major delays.     Teamwork and alignments have never been more important and hereby I would like to express my gratefulness to all of Shams employees who put tremendous effort and absorbed a lot of stress during this difficult month.    \n",

      "  8        GENERAL    Introduction As per the O&M plan, the first major outage scheduled in Year 7 (2020) features the major overhaul of the steam turbine and generator. Due to the prolonged outage duration, all other maintenance activities that require a plant shutdown and time greater than that of a minor outage were considered.     The initial plan drafted for 24 days took into account that the Steam Turbine activities are critical path and there would be no major repair activities other than the rotor replacement. However, the actual situation of the outage did not reflect the same.    The major outage on Shams 1 power plant was executed successfully and safely from 1st March until 4th April 2020 (35 days).    Brief Sequence of Key Events 29th February 2020: Last commercial operation. 1st March 2020: Outage commencement.  4th March 2020: Steam Turbine Turning Gear stopped. 7th March 2020: Entire HTF system draining completed.  17th March 2020: Extension of the outage due to clearance issues on the Steam Turbine. 24th March 2020: MAN Germany team leave UAE and MAN Dubai team arrive onsite. 31st March 2020: Turning gear incident during commissioning.  4th April 2020: Steam Turbine commissioning completed and hand over to operations.   Outage Highlights 1) 0 LTI / MTC / RWC.  2) 204,249 man-hours liquidated.  3) 488 personnel worked onsite.  4) 25 contractors managed by Shams team.  5) 838 welding joints implemented in the Solar Field.  \n",

      "  13        CHAPTER 2: COVID  19 2.1 Challenges The economic and logistics effects of the COVID - 19 pandemic had influenced Shams during the outage like never before. The following were the challenges Shams faced.  1) Dealing with technical findings extended the outage by 7 days. (24th March to 31st March)   a. Travel restrictions complicated the technical issues that required external party specialty workshops to aid in repairs.  2) OEM specialists from MAN & BRUSH left site on 23rd and 24th March respectively.   3) New MAN team from Dubai arrived on 24th March at 1pm, to assemble and commission the machine.  4) There was no handover or any form of information shared between the MAN Germany team and MAN Dubai team. The lack of handover was detrimental because MAN never submitted sufficient documentation prior to the outage e.g. drawings, procedures and protocols.  5) The Lead engineer from MAN Germany removed from the project at soon as he left site. No support from the MAN person who was aware of the complete technical situation at the time.   6) MAN DCS team was inexperienced and not confident at all. This resulted in the turning gear incident.   2.2 Actions taken Shams updated MAN team from Dubai on the status of the outage with all the technical issues that were faced as well as repairs that were currently on-going at the time.  Since there was disconnection between the MAN Germany team and the MAN Dubai team, Shams became the critical link to ensure information passed on in order to proceed with the outage activities.  Shams prepared protocol sheets for the loop, function checks, and shared with MAN DCS Dubai team in order to progress further. This crucial step enable Shams to avoid further delays on an already extended outage.   \n"

In order to continue with other activities it was discussed and agreed with the Dubai MAN DCS team to continue stroking the Governor valve keeping the Stop valve or Trip valve closed while the HP steam line were warmed up with live steam. At the point of execution due to simulation errors, the stop valve opened leading to live steam entering the Steam Turbine while the new turning gear was engaged, the speed reached up to 320 rpm before the stop valve was closed and this lead to the turning gear incident.    The new turning gear was inspected after the incident and found the gear wheel on the new rotor was damage (we had one spare available) as well as the new turning gear had to be replaced with the old one. After these components replaced, the Steam Turbine was successfully commissioned along with the physical Overspeed test (please see Fig 4.2 and ref.

      "  26        CHAPTER 4: GENERATOR    4.1 General The initial scope for the generator was a minor inspection, however there were issues identified with the generator in these areas as shown below (please refer annexure 2a for more details).     1) 2) Generator unbalanced current alarms.  3) Generator Stator Winding temperature.    Due to the above mentioned points and considering the maintenance intervals Shams decided to change the scope from Minor inspection to Major inspection. This required the OEM specialist BRUSH UK to perform the supervision and therefore the scope was divided between two main contractors.    1) The OEM supervision & inspection: BRUSH UK.  2) Third party execution labor force: Turbine Services & Solution with their main subcontractor Ansaldo Energia.      The OEM supervision & inspection team would be responsible for directing the task of the major outage, take all readings and measurements as per protocol, carry out all electrical tests, identify and recommend solutions to all technical findings, commission the generator as per operating parameters and a final outage report submitted to Shams.     The Third party support team would be responsible for supplying experienced labor, provide all the required certified tools, lifting equipment, scaffolding & insulation services, etc.     An additional contractor, Osbourne Engineering Services was involved for the refurbishment of one generator bearing during the outage.

Reassembly Phase  During the reassembly phase the rotor was pulled back into position through the generator stator following the installation of the drive and non-drive end bearings, generator end covers, excitation systems, generator rotating diodes and all electrical, instrumentation and mechanical connections. All mechanical works on the generator were completed once the generator rotor was ready for coupling and alignment with the steam turbine rotor.    COVID-19  Throughout the generator outage phases there were not major concerns, however due to the COVID  19 international travel restrictions Shams requested the BRUSH commissioning engineer to come to site earlier than planned (20th March). Unfortunately, the outage extended due to the findings on the Steam turbine mentioned in Chapter 3. On 4th April 2020, Brush personnel left site without completing the AVR firmware update due to the travel restriction in the UAE (repatriation flight to UK) and therefore this task was not completed. However, the fact that the AVR firmware were not updated has no impact on the availability and reliability of the Generator. It will be implemented at the next opportunity.   4.2 Brief Scope of Works The following scope of works carried out during the major outage.  2) Complete Dismantling of the generator end covers.  \n"

      "  65        8.2 Contingency Calculation During the budget preparation phase for the major outage only 7% of the total outage budget     was considered with the assumption that there would be no major findings. The budget did  not account for the refurbishment cost of components and under estimation of the DCS upgrade that ended up more expensive.    Lesson Learnt  Future major outage contingency amount should be calculated based on the actual expenses records of the major outage 2020.     8.3 Outage Duration The outage duration based upon the assumption that the steam turbine rotor replaced with new and no major findings anticipated, following this, a 24-day schedule was prepared. However, during the outage the actual situation was very different, the technical findings were much more than expected and therefore critical path shifted to repair of these technical findings, causing the extension of the outage.    Lesson Learnt  Future major outage contingency amount should be calculated based on the actual expenses records of the major outage 2020.     8.4 Waste Management The outage activities have generated a huge amount of waste that has accumulated in the waste area. The accumulated waste was found not properly segregated mostly by the contractors where several incompatible wastes have been found in the same bins. Moreover, some waste was simply dumped on bare soil due to lack of waste bins.    Lesson learnt: For future outages, waste management aspect shall be clearly discussed with contractors in addition to provision of sufficient waste bins for proper segregation and disposal.

Following meetings with MAN prior to the outage, they informed Shams that having only three persons would mean an advisory role in which the MAN personnel would only advise rather than supervise and take responsibility for the functionality and time schedule.  2) Steam Turbine DCS upgrade cost was much more than initially anticipated.     The reasons for the Generator over spend was due to the following.  1) Initial scope planned for the generator was a minor inspection, however due the technical issues on the generator bearing, shaft (vibrations) and stator windings (temperature) the scope updated to major inspection.  2) It is making financial sense to synchronize the generator major outage with the steam turbine major outage, the duration for both are approximately the same.  3) This change in scope had no impact on outage duration but the cost increased as shown in the table 2 above.     9.3 Contingency / Extra Works. The extra work on the Steam Turbine consisted of the following.  1) Procurement of raw materials.  2) Fabrication of material spares.  3) Machining of ST components.  4) Additional tools and equipment due to findings such as the drilling machine.  \n",

      " Page 2 of 3   3.0 History  This header is connecting two booster heaters to turbine, comprising many different components like flow meter, steam traps, supports (normal, snippers and spring types). Pipe diameters ranges   is ASTM 335 Gr P91. It was commissioned in 2013 and pavailable.   On 21/02/2017 it was subjected to hammering incident due to condensate accumulation in the line during lined up in the morning. This led to header dislocation at several locations and clashing with adjacent piping, in addition to small diameter associated piping was heavily affected.    On 17.04.2017 it was inspected by REX subsidiary of GIS  MIC, outcome available in their attached report.  On January outage 2018 it was comprehensively inspected to get piping integrity updated data for further stress analysis. Inspection scope included phased array of most affected welding, laser inspection of most affected welding elbow. Outcome was mostly satisfactory.   On April 2018 Flow meter pipe was reported leak from welding of flow meter nozzle to main pipe. Repairing was very difficult due to utilizing of different materials (SS 316 L for Nozzle) and (A 335 P91 for main pipe) and (tapering material Nickle base alloy). Due to repeated cracks during repair welding process it take more than 4 weeks and plant was completely shut down. Based on manufacturer recommendation nozzle material was changed to be same of main pipe material.  On January 2019 a new flow material with new design was installed.  On March 2020 a follow up inspection was carried out and outcome was satisfactory.    4.0. Scope of Inspection       4.1 Visual inspection.      4.2 Phased Array.      4.3 Replica testing  5.0. Conditions Found       5.1 During turbine overall a diameter connected spool to turbine was cut for turbine dismantling,     this led to unbalance of all steam header adjacent piping parts to turbine particularly at its supports.       So, all supports readjusted based on new position of header after welding it back to turbine inlet,          details of readjusted support attached.       5.2 New welding of 14 was carried out by HIDROMONTAZA        contractor, it was welded as per specified welding procedure, heat treated and phased array         inspected successfully.        5.3 While checking materials of the header using PMI instrument a deviation of material specification    found, according it was decided to check all header different parts. Further testing confirmed      difference in header parts materials, some of it showed low grade materials, report attached.  6.0. Recommendations          6.1 It is highly recommended to check suitability of low grade materials of the header with current         operating and design conditions.           6.2 Inspect flow meter pipe within main header inspection program after 4 years as per            SHAMS Code of Practice.   \n",

Scope of Inspection  4.1Visual Inspection 4.2 Eddy Current 4.3 Ultrasonic Thickness survey  4.4 Dye- penetrant  5.4 Borescope inspection    5.0. Conditions Found   5.1. External (Shell side)  5.1.1 All painting and insulation found intact without any evidence of painting peel off or     blistering and no evidence of any damage for insulation or insulation cover aluminum     sheet.  5.1.2 All ladders, stairways and handrails found in satisfactory condition.  5.1.3 All concrete support found in satisfactory condition without evidence of cracking or     spalling.   5.1.4 All external piping insulation found in satisfactory condition.  5.1.5 All earthling lugs found in satisfactory condition.   5.2. Internal (Tube side)  5.2.1 All tubes as could be seen internal surfaces found satisfactory without evidence of severe     corrosion, apart from one tube previously plugged upon pulling it out for further metallurgical   investigation on year 2015.  5.2.2 All tube to tube sheet welds found satisfactory.  5.2.3 All surfaces and welds of channel and pass partition found satisfactory.   5.2.4 All internal surface as could be seen of connected piping to channel found satisfactory.             6.0 NDT     6.1 Ultrasonic thickness survey            Ultrasonic thickness measurement was carried out on accessible locations of channel                        found satisfactory. See attached thickness measurement report.                                              6.2 Dye - Penetrant test                Dye - Penetrant test was carried out on tube to tube sheet welds                                 found satisfactory. See attached thickness measurement report.                      6.3 Eddy Current test                          Eddy current test was carried out on 466 tubes as sample, results was not clear due to high            amplitude noises caused by well know inter-granular corrosion created during tube fabrication           (see attached integrity review report dated December 2017 for more details).                                               6.4 Borescope Inspection                       6.1 Due to presence of inter-granular corrosion damage mechanism in the tubes, a part of            chromium content in stainless steel was depleted in some locations, these locations behave like        carbon steel. As eddy current technique not suitable for testing carbon steel material, a tube         condition cannot be accurately defined using eddy current technique. Also, IRIS suitable          probe for this diameter of tubes not available in the market. So, a nine tubes were selected          for borescope internal visual inspection to visually define internal condition of tubes, all          found no visual defects. Meanwhile, borescope inspection from shell side result was            satisfactory (see attached videos and photos).   \n",

Scope of Inspection  4.1Visual Inspection 4.2 Eddy Current 4.3 Ultrasonic Thickness survey  4.4 Dye- penetrant  5.4 Borescope inspection    5.0. Conditions Found   5.1. External (Shell side)  5.1.1 All painting and insulation found intact without any evidence of painting peel off or     blistering and no evidence of any damage for insulation or insulation cover aluminum     sheet.  5.1.2 All ladders, stairways and handrails found in satisfactory condition.  5.1.3 All concrete support found in satisfactory condition without evidence of cracking or     spalling.   5.1.4 All external piping insulation found in satisfactory condition.  5.1.5 All earthling lugs found in satisfactory condition.   5.2. Internal (Tube side)  5.2.1 All tubes as could be seen internal surfaces found satisfactory without evidence of severe     corrosion.   5.2.2 All tube to tube sheet welds found satisfactory.  5.2.3 All surfaces and welds of channel and pass partition found satisfactory.   5.2.4 All internal surface as could be seen of connected piping to channel found satisfactory.             6.0 NDT     6.1 Ultrasonic thickness survey            Ultrasonic thickness measurement was carried out on accessible locations of channel                        found satisfactory with average thickness 66.00 mm. See attached thickness measurement report.                                              6.2 Dye - Penetrant test                Dye - Penetrant test was carried out on tube to tube sheet welds                                 found satisfactory. See attached thickness measurement report.                      6.3 Eddy Current test                          Eddy current test was carried out on 18 tubes as sample, results was not clear due to high            amplitude noises caused by well know inter-granular corrosion created during tube fabrication           (see attached integrity review report dated December 2017 for more details).                                               6.4 Borescope Inspection                       6.1 Due to presence of inter-granular corrosion damage mechanism in the tubes, a part of            chromium content in stainless steel was depleted in some locations, these locations behave like        carbon steel. As eddy current technique not suitable for testing carbon steel material, a tube         condition cannot be accurately defined using eddy current technique. Also, IRIS suitable          probe for this diameter of tubes not available in the market. So, a five tubes were selected          for borescope internal visual inspection to visually define internal condition of tubes, all          found no visual defects, one of them was eddy current tested. Meanwhile, borescope inspection from       shell side result was satisfactory (see attached videos and photos).   \n",

Scope of Inspection  4.1 Visual inspection. 4.2 Ultrasonic thickness measurement  5.0. Conditions Found  5.1. External  5.1.1 All insulation found intact without any evidence of any damage for insulation or insulation       cover aluminum sheet. 5.1.3 All ladders, stairways and handrails found in satisfactory condition. 5.1.4 All concrete support found in satisfactory condition without evidence of cracking or spalling. 5.1.5 All grounding found in place  5.2. Internal  5.2.1 All internals found in satisfactory condition without evidence of fallen down, damage or    corrosion. It found with black magnetite layer in the lower half of the drum apart from       hematite layer in the upper half of the drum 5.2.2 All internal surfaces of shell and heads found in satisfactory condition with black magnetite  layer in the lower half of the drum apart from hematite layer in the upper half of the drum . 5.2.3 All welds of shell and heads found in satisfactory condition without evidence of corrosion. 5.2.4 All internal surfaces of connected nozzles and manway found in satisfactory condition     without evidence of sever corrosion. 5.2.5 All thermos wells found in satisfactory condition 5.2.6 Manways, nozzle, cover and lock bolts found in satisfactory condition. 5.2.7 There are some iron oxide deposits scattered on upper half of the drum.                 5.8.1. Ultrasonic Testing  Ultrasonic thickness measurement was carried out on the internal shell courses and heads surfaces found satisfactory. Thickness measurement report available.   6.0 Conclusion   -    Hematite (Fe2O3) is favored at high oxygen levels can be red and is a binding agent and tends    to hold over materials in deposition. This is an indication of active corrosion occurring within    the boiler/feed system  - Magnetite (Fe3O4) a smooth black tenacious, dense magnetite layer normally grows on boiler waterside surfaces. Taken to indicate good corrosion protection as it forms in low oxygen levels and is susceptible to acidic attack     7.0. Recommendations      - Review BFW deaerating process to assure absence of oxygen and mitigate                                          any oxygen further corrosion.     - It is recommended to open steam drum -1 after 4 years as per SHAMS Code of Practice.  \n",

       "  ' Page 4 of 8   8.0 Booster Heater Pilot Burner Modification   8.1 Overview During Outage 2020, pilot burner of BHs was replaced by new higher capacity continuously running pilot burner in order to run BH with lower steam flow requirement. This will help to evaporate the condensate inside U type steam tubes of BHs without much reddownstream header. Ultimately, it will save gas consumption in HTF-Hs which will be used in BH to generate electricity more efficiently. The old burner system includes an intermittent igniter. This igniter is brought into service following a purge cycle and is used to ignite main burner operation. Following main burner ignition, the igniter is removed from service. To accommodate the above mentioned requirement for low heat input stand-by service, a new larger igniter was retrofitted. It will be light off prior to main burner start. Logic in BH PLC were implemented to avoid the pilot burner operation continuously during main burner firing.  8.2 Logic Modifications  During the light-off sequence, rather than an automatic transfer from igniter operation to main burner operation, when the igniter is brought into service the BMS system will hold this condition giving indication of HOT STANDBY MODE. Air control devices should be held in minimum light-off positions. Following a 10 second delay, an option should be provided to site operators to TRANSFER TO MAIN BURNER. This option would continue the already programmed transition sequence to main burner operation. After this transition, the system will release to modulate per current logic. A flame scanner signal must be maintained during all modes or otherwise the system should initiate a trip. No automated adjustment of igniter heat input is included in the system. Rather, adjustment of igniter heat input will require mechanical adjustment of the igniter regulator spring setting.                             ',\n",

       "  ' Page 4 of 7    8.0 Booster Heater Pilot Burner Modification   8.1 Overview During Outage 2020, pilot burner of BHs was replaced by new higher capacity continuously running pilot burner in order to run BH with lower steam flow requirement. This will help to evaporate the downstream header. Ultimately, it will save gas consumption in HTF-Hs which will be used in BH to generate electricity more efficiently. The old burner system includes an intermittent igniter. This igniter is brought into service following a purge cycle and is used to ignite main burner operation. Following main burner ignition, the igniter is removed from service. To accommodate the above mentioned requirement for low heat input stand-by service, a new larger igniter was retrofitted. It will be light off prior to main burner start. Logic in BH PLC were implemented to avoid the pilot burner operation continuously during main burner firing.  8.2 Logic Modifications  During the light-off sequence, rather than an automatic transfer from igniter operation to main burner operation, when the igniter is brought into service the BMS system will hold this condition giving indication of HOT STANDBY MODE. Air control devices should be held in minimum light-off positions. Following a 10 second delay, an option should be provided to site operators to TRANSFER TO MAIN BURNER. This option would continue the already programmed transition sequence to main burner operation. After this transition, the system will release to modulate per current logic. A flame scanner signal must be maintained during all modes or otherwise the system should initiate a trip. No automated adjustment of igniter heat input is included in the system. Rather, adjustment of igniter heat input will require mechanical adjustment of the igniter regulator spring setting.                           ',\n",

       "  '  2                  Message from General Manager    The major outage has a significant importance to the long term strategy of Shams plant and assets. The vast scope includes major overhaul and inspection of critical equipment such as  steam turbine, generator, booster heaters, HTF heaters, DCS upgrade and others. These are critical assets and equipment that impact the business of Shams directly, thus  of paramount importance to ensure its reliability, availability, and efficiency over its lifetime.    There were many factors that contributed to the success of major outage. Some of those were preparation and planning, procurement and contracting, vendors and contractors management. Shams team made great efforts to ensure all these factors successfully completed in a timely manner.    This was the first major outage in Shams history and we all had a big pressure to demonstrate our competency, high performance and timely completion of this goal. The total investment and the duration of the outage has added more pressure from a financial perspective.         Managing the engagement of over 400 people at site and over 191,000 work-man hours presented unparalleled safety and operational challenge. Additionally, the circumstances that was forced upon us due to COVID-19 with the panic around the world, uncertainties, and psychological impact on everyone; added greater challenges and pressure on everyone. I am proud to state that our HSE records were excellent, and that we successfully implemented all precautionary measures recommended. Since our people are our greatest asset, I am pleased to confirm that there was no single case of major HSE incident reported which is complementing our outstanding record of no LTI since January 2016.     All technical challenges, unexpected deficiencies, challenges of managing multiple contractors, difficulties handled successfully by Shams team. We were constantly facing much further delays that could have resulted in greater lost production. However, thankfully to our skilled team, I have a privilege to say that the complete scope was successfully completed and without major delays.     Teamwork and alignments have never been more important and hereby I would like to express my gratefulness to all of Shams employees who put tremendous effort and absorbed a lot of stress during this difficult month.

       "  '  8        GENERAL    Introduction As per the O&M plan, the first major outage scheduled in Year 7 (2020) features the major overhaul of the steam turbine and generator. Due to the prolonged outage duration, all other maintenance activities that require a plant shutdown and time greater than that of a minor outage were considered.     The initial plan drafted for 24 days took into account that the Steam Turbine activities are critical path and there would be no major repair activities other than the rotor replacement. However, the actual situation of the outage did not reflect the same.    The major outage on Shams 1 power plant was executed successfully and safely from 1st March until 4th April 2020 (35 days).    Brief Sequence of Key Events 29th February 2020: Last commercial operation. 1st March 2020: Outage commencement.  4th March 2020: Steam Turbine Turning Gear stopped. 7th March 2020: Entire HTF system draining completed.  17th March 2020: Extension of the outage due to clearance issues on the Steam Turbine. 24th March 2020: MAN Germany team leave UAE and MAN Dubai team arrive onsite. 31st March 2020: Turning gear incident during commissioning.  4th April 2020: Steam Turbine commissioning completed and hand over to operations.

The following were the challenges Shams faced.  1) Dealing with technical findings extended the outage by 7 days. (24th March to 31st March)   a. Travel restrictions complicated the technical issues that required external party specialty workshops to aid in repairs.  2) OEM specialists from MAN & BRUSH left site on 23rd and 24th March respectively.   3) New MAN team from Dubai arrived on 24th March at 1pm, to assemble and commission the machine.  4) There was no handover or any form of information shared between the MAN Germany team and MAN Dubai team. The lack of handover was detrimental because MAN never submitted sufficient documentation prior to the outage e.g. drawings, procedures and protocols.  5) The Lead engineer from MAN Germany removed from the project at soon as he left site. No support from the MAN person who was aware of the complete technical situation at the time.   6) MAN DCS team was inexperienced and not confident at all. This resulted in the turning gear incident.   2.2 Actions taken Shams updated MAN team from Dubai on the status of the outage with all the technical issues that were faced as well as repairs that were currently on-going at the time.  Since there was disconnection between the MAN Germany team and the MAN Dubai team, Shams became the critical link to ensure information passed on in order to proceed with the outage activities.  Shams prepared protocol sheets for the loop, function checks, and shared with MAN DCS Dubai team in order to progress further. This crucial step enable Shams to avoid further delays on an already extended outage.   ',\n",

In order to continue with other activities it was discussed and agreed with the Dubai MAN DCS team to continue stroking the Governor valve keeping the Stop valve or Trip valve closed while the HP steam line were warmed up with live steam. At the point of execution due to simulation errors, the stop valve opened leading to live steam entering the Steam Turbine while the new turning gear was engaged, the speed reached up to 320 rpm before the stop valve was closed and this lead to the turning gear incident.    The new turning gear was inspected after the incident and found the gear wheel on the new rotor was damage (we had one spare available) as well as the new turning gear had to be replaced with the old one. After these components replaced, the Steam Turbine was successfully commissioned along with the physical Overspeed test (please see Fig 4.2 and ref.

All mechanical works on the generator were completed once the generator rotor was ready for coupling and alignment with the steam turbine rotor.    COVID-19  Throughout the generator outage phases there were not major concerns, however due to the COVID  19 international travel restrictions Shams requested the BRUSH commissioning engineer to come to site earlier than planned (20th March). Unfortunately, the outage extended due to the findings on the Steam turbine mentioned in Chapter 3. On 4th April 2020, Brush personnel left site without completing the AVR firmware update due to the travel restriction in the UAE (repatriation flight to UK) and therefore this task was not completed.

       "  '  31        CHAPTER 5: POWER BLOCK 5.1 General The major outage on the steam turbine required all other equipment in the power block to be offline and isolated, therefore all other maintenance activities on the power block that require a plant shutdown and time greater than that of a minor outage were considered.     The Power Block consist of the all auxiliary equipment such as Booster Heaters systems, Solar Steam Generators systems, Feed-water systems, Gas & Oil systems, Valves, Pumps, Motors, Transformers, Switchgears, Instrumentations, etc.    The maintenance activities divided into three in terms of services as shown below.  1) In house: Maintenance activities implemented by Shams teams.  2) Outsourced: Maintenance activities implemented by contractor teams.  3) Support services: These activities were scaffolding, inspection, insulation, crane & labor supply.     The strategy was to allocate one or two main contractors as a lump sum contract to implement all outsourced maintenance activates as specified in the scope of works. Two companies were identified as shown below.   1) NICO international: Responsible for all the valves, pumps, motors & heat exchangers maintenance activities.   2) Turbine Services and Solutions. Responsible for the all-electrical equipment such as the transformers, switchgears, battery chargers, batteries, etc. maintenance activities.    Support services such as scaffolding, insulation, mobile cranes and labor supply were required during various maintenance activities. Below are the contractor involved.  1) National Protection and Painting Company - Scaffolding & Insulation services.  2) Al Faris  Mobile crane services.  3) International Inspection Services.  4) NICO international  Labor supply.

Following meetings with MAN prior to the outage, they informed Shams that having only three persons would mean an advisory role in which the MAN personnel would only advise rather than supervise and take responsibility for the functionality and time schedule.  2) Steam Turbine DCS upgrade cost was much more than initially anticipated.     The reasons for the Generator over spend was due to the following.  1) Initial scope planned for the generator was a minor inspection, however due the technical issues on the generator bearing, shaft (vibrations) and stator windings (temperature) the scope updated to major inspection.  2) It is making financial sense to synchronize the generator major outage with the steam turbine major outage, the duration for both are approximately the same.  3) This change in scope had no impact on outage duration but the cost increased as shown in the table 2 above.     9.3 Contingency / Extra Works. The extra work on the Steam Turbine consisted of the following.  1) Procurement of raw materials.  2) Fabrication of material spares.  3) Machining of ST components.  4) Additional tools and equipment due to findings such as the drilling machine.

Pipe diameters ranges   is ASTM 335 Gr P91. It was commissioned in 2013 and pavailable.   On 21/02/2017 it was subjected to hammering incident due to condensate accumulation in the line during lined up in the morning. This led to header dislocation at several locations and clashing with adjacent piping, in addition to small diameter associated piping was heavily affected.    On 17.04.2017 it was inspected by REX subsidiary of GIS  MIC, outcome available in their attached report.  On January outage 2018 it was comprehensively inspected to get piping integrity updated data for further stress analysis. Inspection scope included phased array of most affected welding, laser inspection of most affected welding elbow. Outcome was mostly satisfactory.   On April 2018 Flow meter pipe was reported leak from welding of flow meter nozzle to main pipe. Repairing was very difficult due to utilizing of different materials (SS 316 L for Nozzle) and (A 335 P91 for main pipe) and (tapering material Nickle base alloy). Due to repeated cracks during repair welding process it take more than 4 weeks and plant was completely shut down. Based on manufacturer recommendation nozzle material was changed to be same of main pipe material.  On January 2019 a new flow material with new design was installed.  On March 2020 a follow up inspection was carried out and outcome was satisfactory.    4.0. Scope of Inspection       4.1 Visual inspection.      4.2 Phased Array.      4.3 Replica testing  5.0. Conditions Found       5.1 During turbine overall a diameter connected spool to turbine was cut for turbine dismantling,     this led to unbalance of all steam header adjacent piping parts to turbine particularly at its supports.       So, all supports readjusted based on new position of header after welding it back to turbine inlet,          details of readjusted support attached.       5.2 New welding of 14 was carried out by HIDROMONTAZA        contractor, it was welded as per specified welding procedure, heat treated and phased array         inspected successfully.        5.3 While checking materials of the header using PMI instrument a deviation of material specification    found, according it was decided to check all header different parts. Further testing confirmed      difference in header parts materials, some of it showed low grade materials, report attached.  6.0. Recommendations          6.1 It is highly recommended to check suitability of low grade materials of the header with current         operating and design conditions.           6.2 Inspect flow meter pipe within main header inspection program after 4 years as per            SHAMS Code of Practice.

External (Shell side)  5.1.1 All painting and insulation found intact without any evidence of painting peel off or     blistering and no evidence of any damage for insulation or insulation cover aluminum     sheet.  5.1.2 All ladders, stairways and handrails found in satisfactory condition.  5.1.3 All concrete support found in satisfactory condition without evidence of cracking or     spalling.   5.1.4 All external piping insulation found in satisfactory condition.  5.1.5 All earthling lugs found in satisfactory condition.   5.2. Internal (Tube side)  5.2.1 All tubes as could be seen internal surfaces found satisfactory without evidence of severe     corrosion, apart from one tube previously plugged upon pulling it out for further metallurgical   investigation on year 2015.  5.2.2 All tube to tube sheet welds found satisfactory.  5.2.3 All surfaces and welds of channel and pass partition found satisfactory.   5.2.4 All internal surface as could be seen of connected piping to channel found satisfactory.             6.0 NDT     6.1 Ultrasonic thickness survey            Ultrasonic thickness measurement was carried out on accessible locations of channel                        found satisfactory. See attached thickness measurement report.                                              6.2 Dye - Penetrant test                Dye - Penetrant test was carried out on tube to tube sheet welds                                 found satisfactory. See attached thickness measurement report.                      6.3 Eddy Current test                          Eddy current test was carried out on 466 tubes as sample, results was not clear due to high            amplitude noises caused by well know inter-granular corrosion created during tube fabrication           (see attached integrity review report dated December 2017 for more details).                                               6.4 Borescope Inspection                       6.1 Due to presence of inter-granular corrosion damage mechanism in the tubes, a part of            chromium content in stainless steel was depleted in some locations, these locations behave like        carbon steel. As eddy current technique not suitable for testing carbon steel material, a tube         condition cannot be accurately defined using eddy current technique. Also, IRIS suitable          probe for this diameter of tubes not available in the market. So, a nine tubes were selected          for borescope internal visual inspection to visually define internal condition of tubes, all          found no visual defects. Meanwhile, borescope inspection from shell side result was            satisfactory (see attached videos and photos).   ',\n",

Internal (Tube side)  5.2.1 All tubes as could be seen internal surfaces found satisfactory without evidence of severe     corrosion.   5.2.2 All tube to tube sheet welds found satisfactory.  5.2.3 All surfaces and welds of channel and pass partition found satisfactory.   5.2.4 All internal surface as could be seen of connected piping to channel found satisfactory.             6.0 NDT     6.1 Ultrasonic thickness survey            Ultrasonic thickness measurement was carried out on accessible locations of channel                        found satisfactory with average thickness 66.00 mm. See attached thickness measurement report.                                              6.2 Dye - Penetrant test                Dye - Penetrant test was carried out on tube to tube sheet welds                                 found satisfactory. See attached thickness measurement report.                      6.3 Eddy Current test                          Eddy current test was carried out on 18 tubes as sample, results was not clear due to high            amplitude noises caused by well know inter-granular corrosion created during tube fabrication           (see attached integrity review report dated December 2017 for more details).                                               6.4 Borescope Inspection                       6.1 Due to presence of inter-granular corrosion damage mechanism in the tubes, a part of            chromium content in stainless steel was depleted in some locations, these locations behave like        carbon steel. As eddy current technique not suitable for testing carbon steel material, a tube         condition cannot be accurately defined using eddy current technique. Also, IRIS suitable          probe for this diameter of tubes not available in the market. So, a five tubes were selected          for borescope internal visual inspection to visually define internal condition of tubes, all          found no visual defects, one of them was eddy current tested. Meanwhile, borescope inspection from       shell side result was satisfactory (see attached videos and photos).   ',\n",

External  5.1.1 All insulation found intact without any evidence of any damage for insulation or insulation       cover aluminum sheet. 5.1.3 All ladders, stairways and handrails found in satisfactory condition. 5.1.4 All concrete support found in satisfactory condition without evidence of cracking or spalling. 5.1.5 All grounding found in place  5.2. Internal  5.2.1 All internals found in satisfactory condition without evidence of fallen down, damage or    corrosion. It found with black magnetite layer in the lower half of the drum apart from       hematite layer in the upper half of the drum 5.2.2 All internal surfaces of shell and heads found in satisfactory condition with black magnetite  layer in the lower half of the drum apart from hematite layer in the upper half of the drum . 5.2.3 All welds of shell and heads found in satisfactory condition without evidence of corrosion. 5.2.4 All internal surfaces of connected nozzles and manway found in satisfactory condition     without evidence of sever corrosion. 5.2.5 All thermos wells found in satisfactory condition 5.2.6 Manways, nozzle, cover and lock bolts found in satisfactory condition. 5.2.7 There are some iron oxide deposits scattered on upper half of the drum.                 5.8.1. Ultrasonic Testing  Ultrasonic thickness measurement was carried out on the internal shell courses and heads surfaces found satisfactory. Thickness measurement report available.   6.0 Conclusion   -    Hematite (Fe2O3) is favored at high oxygen levels can be red and is a binding agent and tends    to hold over materials in deposition. This is an indication of active corrosion occurring within    the boiler/feed system  - Magnetite (Fe3O4) a smooth black tenacious, dense magnetite layer normally grows on boiler waterside surfaces. Taken to indicate good corrosion protection as it forms in low oxygen levels and is susceptible to acidic attack     7.0. Recommendations      - Review BFW deaerating process to assure absence of oxygen and mitigate                                          any oxygen further corrosion.     - It is recommended to open steam drum -1 after 4 years as per SHAMS Code of Practice.
