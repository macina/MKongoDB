Periodical inspection records since Oct2014 are available. Three tubes were plugged as it was taken as a sample for metallurgical investigation on     years 2014, 2015 & 2016.  4.0. SCOPE OF INSPECTION  4.1Visual Inspection 4.2 Eddy Current 4.3 Ultrasonic Thickness survey  4.4 Dye- penetrant  5.4 Borescope inspection   5.0. CONDITIONS FOUND  5.1. External (Shell side) 5.1.1 All painting and insulation found intact without any evidence of painting peel off or     blistering and no evidence of any damage for insulation or insulation cover aluminum     sheet. 5.1.2 All ladders, stairways and handrails found in satisfactory condition. 5.1.3 All concrete support found in satisfactory condition without evidence of cracking or     spalling.  5.1.4 All external piping insulation found in satisfactory condition. 5.1.5 All earthling lugs found in satisfactory condition.  5.2. Internal (Tube side) 5.2.1 All tubes as could see internal surfaces found satisfactory condition without evidence of   corrosion, apart from a considerable amounts of deposits which have cleaned by high pressure hydro jetting. 5.2.2 Three tubes were plugged as it was taken as a sample for metallurgical investigation on     years 2014, 2015 & 2016. 5.2.3 All tube to tube sheet welds found in satisfactory condition.        6.0 NDT   6.1 Ultrasonic thickness survey            Ultrasonic thickness measurement was carried out on accessible locations of channel                       found satisfactory with average thickness 10.40 mm. See attached thickness measurement    report.                                            6.2 Dye  Penetrant test                Dye  Penetrant test was carried out on tube to tube sheet welds                               found satisfactory. See attached thickness measurement report.                   6.3 Eddy Current test                          - Eddy current test was carried out on 56 tubes as sample out of total nos. 1018, results was        not clear due to high amplitude noises caused by well-known inter-granular corrosion         created during tube fabrication (for more details see attached integrity review report dated       December 2017 and eddy current report). Meanwhile, RFT was used as a trail to detect        carbon steel parts due to inter-granular corrosion but it was failed.                              Page 3 of 4                       6.4 borescope Inspection                         Due to presence of inter-granular corrosion, tube thickness cannot be accurately measured using      eddy current technique and IRIS suitable probe for this diameter of tube not available in the           market, borescope was utilized as visual inspection aid tool inside some tubes and outside from      shell side, result was satisfactory (see attached videos and photos).  7.0. Recommendations          LP heater -1 should be open for inspection after four years as per SHAMS code of practice.  8.0 Inspection Grade and Interval  In accordance with the latest revision of SHAMS Code of Practice, this LP Heater -1 was endorsed for 48 months under class 2, for next Major Inspection.

Most of the tubes are exhibiting noisy signals suspected the presence of ferromagnetic contents in the tube material. All of these tube data are appeared as ID Corrosion in ECT analysis whereas which could not be relevant if any changes occurred on electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability of the material under test. More over there is chances to miss real defect indications if any exist within the noisy signals region.   9 tubes were selected for boroscopy and found no visual defects in ID surface. ECT data images are attached in this report. Some tubes in the bottom row are showing the signs of OD Pitting.
