The vast scope includes major overhaul and inspection of critical equipment such as  steam turbine, generator, booster heaters, HTF heaters, DCS upgrade and others. These are critical assets and equipment that impact the business of Shams directly, thus  of paramount importance to ensure its reliability, availability, and efficiency over its lifetime.    There were many factors that contributed to the success of major outage. Some of those were preparation and planning, procurement and contracting, vendors and contractors management. Shams team made great efforts to ensure all these factors successfully completed in a timely manner.    This was the first major outage in Shams history and we all had a big pressure to demonstrate our competency, high performance and timely completion of this goal. The total investment and the duration of the outage has added more pressure from a financial perspective.         Managing the engagement of over 400 people at site and over 191,000 work-man hours presented unparalleled safety and operational challenge. Additionally, the circumstances that was forced upon us due to COVID-19 with the panic around the world, uncertainties, and psychological impact on everyone; added greater challenges and pressure on everyone. I am proud to state that our HSE records were excellent, and that we successfully implemented all precautionary measures recommended. Since our people are our greatest asset, I am pleased to confirm that there was no single case of major HSE incident reported which is complementing our outstanding record of no LTI since January 2016.     All technical challenges, unexpected deficiencies, challenges of managing multiple contractors, difficulties handled successfully by Shams team. We were constantly facing much further delays that could have resulted in greater lost production. However, thankfully to our skilled team, I have a privilege to say that the complete scope was successfully completed and without major delays.     Teamwork and alignments have never been more important and hereby I would like to express my gratefulness to all of Shams employees who put tremendous effort and absorbed a lot of stress during this difficult month.      3        Shams demonstrated the power and leadership at the market again. I am delighted that we continue to be the pioneers of the renewable energy, demonstrating the knowledge and showing our unique experience in CSP to the world.     I believe this marks the beginning of prosperous year for all of us, and I am looking forward to celebrate more achievements and success in the next period. I strongly believe this team will continue to path the road toward success.

Due to the prolonged outage duration, all other maintenance activities that require a plant shutdown and time greater than that of a minor outage were considered.     The initial plan drafted for 24 days took into account that the Steam Turbine activities are critical path and there would be no major repair activities other than the rotor replacement. However, the actual situation of the outage did not reflect the same.    The major outage on Shams 1 power plant was executed successfully and safely from 1st March until 4th April 2020 (35 days).    Brief Sequence of Key Events 29th February 2020: Last commercial operation. 1st March 2020: Outage commencement.  4th March 2020: Steam Turbine Turning Gear stopped. 7th March 2020: Entire HTF system draining completed.  17th March 2020: Extension of the outage due to clearance issues on the Steam Turbine. 24th March 2020: MAN Germany team leave UAE and MAN Dubai team arrive onsite. 31st March 2020: Turning gear incident during commissioning.  4th April 2020: Steam Turbine commissioning completed and hand over to operations.   Outage Highlights 1) 0 LTI / MTC / RWC.  2) 204,249 man-hours liquidated.  3) 488 personnel worked onsite.  4) 25 contractors managed by Shams team.  5) 838 welding joints implemented in the Solar Field.    9        Chapters This report divided into five sections as shown below. Chapter 1: Safety  Chapter 2: COVID - 19 Chapter 3: Steam Turbine Chapter 4: Generator Chapter 5: Power Block Chapter 6: Solar Field Chapter 7: Projects Chapter 8: Lessons Learnt Annexures   Note: All detailed technical reports are available on request.                                      10        CHAPTER 1: SAFETY    1.1 Challenges To implement the planned outage scope in March over 450 personnel were involved. This meant that there was increase potential of incidents and accidents onsite. The challenge was to educate and enforce Shams safety rules 24 hours in order to prevent Lost Time Incidents.  Other challenges included:   1) PTW review and Risk assessment of more than 436 Work Orders without any delay.   2) High Risk potential hazards.  a. HTF  Fire Hazard.  b. High number of heavy lifts.  c. Use of make shift tools which are not certified.  d. Two shifts in all areas of plant.  e. Management of Co-activities.  3) Risk of Infections due to COVID  19.   1.2 Measures applied by Shams In order to cover and mitigate all potential hazards and risks the following measures were taken before, during and after outage.  1. Safety induction meeting prior to outage.   2. Contractors gatherings and toolbox talks (See Fig. 1)  3.  supervisors.  4. Rescue training for outsourced safety officers.  5. Site PTW audits and safety requirements compliance reviews.  6. Introduction between contractors and Shams supervisors. (See Fig. 2)  7. Detailed planning to ensure everyone knew what to do on the first day and every day after.  8. Shams inspections to ensure correct tools and equipment used during the outage.  9.

Ensuring daily site clean-up and shifting of all generated waste to waste area.     Figure 1: Safety induction meeting prior to outage. Figure 2: Introduction between contractors and Shams.   1.3 Outcome The outage spanned a total of 35 days and had plethora of activities happening at the same time. With the above measure taken, the following were the outcome.  1) Zero LTI / MTC / RWC.   2) Draining of 600 Tons of HTF by Operations without any spills.   3) Isolated and draining HTF system 2 days ahead of schedule.    12        4) Issued Permits to work daily without any delays.   5) Zero known COVID  19 infections.   6) Three First Aid cases.   7) One HTF spill recorded during outage period.             13        CHAPTER 2: COVID  19 2.1 Challenges The economic and logistics effects of the COVID - 19 pandemic had influenced Shams during the outage like never before. The following were the challenges Shams faced.  1) Dealing with technical findings extended the outage by 7 days. (24th March to 31st March)   a. Travel restrictions complicated the technical issues that required external party specialty workshops to aid in repairs.  2) OEM specialists from MAN & BRUSH left site on 23rd and 24th March respectively.   3) New MAN team from Dubai arrived on 24th March at 1pm, to assemble and commission the machine.  4) There was no handover or any form of information shared between the MAN Germany team and MAN Dubai team. The lack of handover was detrimental because MAN never submitted sufficient documentation prior to the outage e.g. drawings, procedures and protocols.  5) The Lead engineer from MAN Germany removed from the project at soon as he left site. No support from the MAN person who was aware of the complete technical situation at the time.   6) MAN DCS team was inexperienced and not confident at all. This resulted in the turning gear incident.   2.2 Actions taken Shams updated MAN team from Dubai on the status of the outage with all the technical issues that were faced as well as repairs that were currently on-going at the time.  Since there was disconnection between the MAN Germany team and the MAN Dubai team, Shams became the critical link to ensure information passed on in order to proceed with the outage activities.  Shams prepared protocol sheets for the loop, function checks, and shared with MAN DCS Dubai team in order to progress further. This crucial step enable Shams to avoid further delays on an already extended outage.     14        Shams re planned repair activities and shuffled personnel such that the new travel restrictions due to COVID  19 implemented in the country which minimal impact on the outage.   2.3 Outcome This was an exceptional challenge and despite the impact of COVID 19 and OEM specialists leaving site, Shams managed to complete the outage.  Successful commissioning of the Steam Turbine with inexperienced DCS team and insufficient OEM documents or procedures.  Performed the Steam Turbine Over-speed test successfully.    15        CHAPTER 3: STEAM TURBINE    3.1 General Shams employed a strategy where in the execution of the major outage on the steam turbine would be divided into two main contractors working under Shams.     1) The OEM supervision: MAN Energy Solutions.  2) Third party execution labor force: Turbine Services & Solutions (Sanad Powertech) with their main subcontractor Ansaldo Energia.     The OEM supervision team would be responsible for directing the task of the major outage, take all readings and measurements as per protocol, identify and recommend solutions to all technical findings, lead with commissioning activities until the Steam Turbine was functional as per operating parameters and A final outage report submitted to Shams.     The Third party support team would be responsible implementation of the planned & unplanned activities provide all the required certified tools, lifting equipment, experienced labor, scaffolding & insulation services, office cabins, etc.   Additional contractors were also involved based on the technical finding repairs required during outage, as shown below.  1) EM Hydromontaza  HP pipe cutting, welding, and pipe supports inspection and repairs.  2) Petro Engineering Power Services  Honing of coupling bolts.  3) Rainbow Mechanical Solutions  Machining of Steam Turbine components.  4) CAPE East LLC  Steam Turbine Re-Insulation.    The initial plan drafted was for 24 days and took into account that there would be no major repair activities other than the rotor replacement. However, the actual situation of the outage     The steam turbine outage divided into four phases: Dismantling phase, Inspection phase, Re- assembly phase and Commissioning phase.  was very different.   Antonio.Antonuccio 2021-02-11 11:11:07 -------------------------------------------- Indication that there was a discrepancy between  what they were expecting/planning to do based on available info and the actual work they had to perform   16        Dismantling Phase  During the dismantling phase we identified the inlet HP pipe (material: P91) was not flanged   but welded and had to cut in order to remove the massive top steam turbine outer casing. Fig.  3 shows lifting of the top outer casing.     Figure 3: The lifting of the steam turbine top outer casing.    The P91 pipe was cut 20 cm above the heat affected zone from the previous weld as shown in Fig. 3.1. A pneumatic profile cutter was used to cut the pipe with the specified welding beveling profile, as shown in Fig. 3.2.  Antonio.Antonuccio 2021-02-11 11:12:23 -------------------------------------------- Again they missed a key piece of information  about one of the most critical components - this should have been clearly visible in the original drawing or in the commissioning reports   17          HP header connection to the Steam Turbine Technical specification:   HP Header material  P91   ST Nozzle material  P91   Pipe external Diameter  406.4mm   Pipe wall thickness  26.19mm   HP below header material  P22                     Figure 3.1: Marking point of the pipe cutting on the HP pipe inlet.     Figure 3.2: Pipe cutting on the HP pipe inlet.   Safety Note: The overhead crane vertical limits had to be adjusted in order to remove the rotor and was return to original setting after commissioning.    Inspection / Technical finding Phase  Towards the end of the inspection phase when the final clearance measurements taken with the new rotor installed we soon realized that the clearance were too small and therefore many   in Abu Dhabi & Dubai. These findings resulted in a 7 days extension of the outage (Ref. Annexure 1 for detailed findings report).   of the steam turbine stator components had to be machined in specialized machine workshops   Antonio.Antonuccio 2021-02-11 11:33:12 -------------------------------------------- Lack of information on the shape and size of the asset led to 7 days extension    18       balance pistons, inner casing horizontal bolts, connection pins between turbine and casing had  During the reassembly phase, we identified that the new rotor coupling bolt holes were   Even though we ordered the recommended spares from the OEM, many spares such as the   to be fabricated from raw materials X22 e.g. shown in Fig. 4.   Figure 4: showing apiece cut out & fabricated into spare part indicated by the arrow.    We also identified the HP piping support were damaged and deformed in many locations. Shams then assigned Ansaldo Energia who specialize in this area to survey (Ref. Annexure 7 for detailed Ansaldo report) and rectify these issues. The HP header was elevated to ensure no stress induced on the Steam Turbine casing.     COVID-19  On 23rd March 2020, MAN supervision & DCS team from Germany who had been working onsite since the commencement of the outage, decided to leave site following the instructions from their Germany head office due to the COVID  19 pandemic. The new MAN team from Dubai arrived the next day in the afternoon and were clueless as there were no handover information passed from the Germany MAN team. Shams had to orient and bring them up to speed with the latest, which was challenging because no viable documents shared by the OEM (MAN Energy Solutions).    Reassembly Phase   undersized and honing was required. A preliminary contractor (recommended by OEM) brought to ream the holes however; they were stopped by Shams following the damage on the first hole  Antonio.Antonuccio 2021-02-11 11:34:03 -------------------------------------------- indication of lack of proper parts inventory?

Later, during the reassembly phase another time slot was identified and this time a specialized company Petro Engineering Power Services (PEPS) was brought and completed the job perfectly.   After the top outer casing were finally installed, the P91 HP steam header was re-welded to the upper casing (Ref. to annexure 6 for the detailed welding procedure). Post weld heat treatment was then applied and allowed to cool down naturally until final radiography (Non Destructive   Please see Fig 4.1.                        Figure 4.1: Welding, PWHT and final testing of HP pipe.    During the welding of the HP pipe 8 dial gauges installed around the steam turbine to monitor the slightest movement that may result from the welding of the inlet HP pipe. There was no movement identified.     Commissioning Phase  The commissioning phase had to be coordinated between the Dubai MAN Supervision and DCS team. During this time, the Dubai MAN DCS team were struggling to complete the various  Testing) was taken and revealed positive results.   Antonio.Antonuccio 2021-02-11 11:40:50 -------------------------------------------- AI-driven technology can be applied to  deliver a higher quality inspection and reporting   20        logic and protection tests, moreover on the Steam Turbine the new governor valve actuator had issues (details on Annexure 3). In order to continue with other activities it was discussed and agreed with the Dubai MAN DCS team to continue stroking the Governor valve keeping the Stop valve or Trip valve closed while the HP steam line were warmed up with live steam. At the point of execution due to simulation errors, the stop valve opened leading to live steam entering the Steam Turbine while the new turning gear was engaged, the speed reached up to 320 rpm before the stop valve was closed and this lead to the turning gear incident.    The new turning gear was inspected after the incident and found the gear wheel on the new rotor was damage (we had one spare available) as well as the new turning gear had to be replaced with the old one. After these components replaced, the Steam Turbine was successfully commissioned along with the physical Overspeed test (please see Fig 4.2 and ref. Annexure 3 for detailed MAN report, page 130) and handed over back to operation on 4th April 2020.        Figure 4.2: Overspeed Protocol  Ref. Annexure 3.    21       Inspection and analysis of HP pipes and Pipe Supports.   3.2 Brief Scope of Works The following scope of works carried out during the major outage.    1) Steam Turbine  a.

The Steam Turbine is cleared by MAN (OEM) to operate for next 7 years.   This   In addition MAN provided a poor findings and outage reports. Shams is still in the process of negotiating with the OEM to obtain detailed technical documentation and a more comprehensive report.     MAN supplied the minimum technical documentation due to intellectual property rights. Lower part of the HP pipe to the top casing material was found different  Antonio.Antonuccio 2021-02-11 11:49:27 -------------------------------------------- Mismatch of info/data between drawings/specs and actual part - which info was collected on the installed component?

Review list of spares to be refurbished and keep ready for next major outage.  b. Order required spares in time for the next major outage.  c. ST Vibration and Speed pick up sensors must be replaced in the next major outage, as per MAN recommendations. Please note, the gap and direction check of the speed pickup sensors should be checked before closing the NDE bearing.  d. Upper and lower casing instruments must be replaced in the next major outage.    g. Define the commissioning procedures for the lube oil and turning gear with the OEM.  h. The Overspeed test was successfully completed and should be done during the next major outage.  i.  j. Special tools to be inspected and verified 1 year prior to the major outage.  k. All spare parts to be verified with the OEM 1 year prior to the major outage.  l. Arrange machining contracts with workshops in Abu Dhabi and Dubai prior to the major outage.  m. Arrange adequate raw special materials to manufacture ST components in case of findings (X22 material).   n. o. The HP header should be blocked with a special tool to prevent it from moving before cutting  p. Cutting of the HP header should be done with a pneumatic profile cutter to save time and to prevent the magnetism of the HP header.  q. The HP header should be checked for cleanliness before final installation of the steam turbine upper casing.  r. Lube oil coolers overhauling must be implemented every major outage.     Ref. Annexure 1, 3 & 4e for detailed reports.  Cutting, welding, heat treatment and NDT of the HP header should be included  The required documentation must be specified in the RFQ and contract before  Antonio.Antonuccio 2021-02-11 11:52:18 -------------------------------------------- How can the maintenance strategy be enhanced  through availability/access to better asset integrity info?

Due to the above mentioned points and considering the maintenance intervals Shams decided to change the scope from Minor inspection to Major inspection. This required the OEM specialist BRUSH UK to perform the supervision and therefore the scope was divided between two main contractors.    1) The OEM supervision & inspection: BRUSH UK.  2) Third party execution labor force: Turbine Services & Solution with their main subcontractor Ansaldo Energia.      The OEM supervision & inspection team would be responsible for directing the task of the major outage, take all readings and measurements as per protocol, carry out all electrical tests, identify and recommend solutions to all technical findings, commission the generator as per operating parameters and a final outage report submitted to Shams.     The Third party support team would be responsible for supplying experienced labor, provide all the required certified tools, lifting equipment, scaffolding & insulation services, etc.     An additional contractor, Osbourne Engineering Services was involved for the refurbishment of one generator bearing during the outage.    Drive End and Non Drive End bearing Vibrations.    27        The plan drafted was for 18 days with the outage divided into four phases: Dismantling phase, Inspection & testing phase, Re-assembly phase and commissioning phase.    Dismantling Phase  The generator dismantling commenced with the removal of mechanical, electrical and instrumentation connections following by the removal of the generator rotating diodes, the generator excitation system, generator end covers, and top & bottom bearings.   An additional scaffolding platform and a special certified tool called the Turfer were essential to pull out the generator rotor onto a railing with the support of wooden cradle (please see Fig. 11) for inspection and testing.     Figure 11: Generator rotor slide out for inspection and testing.    Inspection & Testing Phase  During the inspection phase, both the DE and NDE bearings were found with light scoring marks, the NDE was replaced with spare and the DE bearing was installed after its refurbishment. Also, the rotor inter-slot wedges showed signs of migration, they were re-peened into position.     Ref. Annexure 2b for detailed Brush report.      28        The following electrical tests were carried out on the rotor and stator.  a. Insulation Resistance tests.   b. Stator core test.   c. Electromagnetic Core Imperfection Detection test (ELCID).  d. Rotor core and winding tests.   e. Generator protection tests.   f. Wedge tap test.    g. Repetitive Surge Oscillation test.   h. Rotor Earth fault test.    All electrical tests results showed nominal. Kindly ref. Annexure 2b for detailed Brush report.    Reassembly Phase  During the reassembly phase the rotor was pulled back into position through the generator stator following the installation of the drive and non-drive end bearings, generator end covers, excitation systems, generator rotating diodes and all electrical, instrumentation and mechanical connections. All mechanical works on the generator were completed once the generator rotor was ready for coupling and alignment with the steam turbine rotor.    COVID-19  Throughout the generator outage phases there were not major concerns, however due to the COVID  19 international travel restrictions Shams requested the BRUSH commissioning engineer to come to site earlier than planned (20th March). Unfortunately, the outage extended due to the findings on the Steam turbine mentioned in Chapter 3. On 4th April 2020, Brush personnel left site without completing the AVR firmware update due to the travel restriction in the UAE (repatriation flight to UK) and therefore this task was not completed. However, the fact that the AVR firmware were not updated has no impact on the availability and reliability of the Generator. It will be implemented at the next opportunity.   4.2 Brief Scope of Works The following scope of works carried out during the major outage.  2) Complete Dismantling of the generator end covers.    29        3) Sliding out of generator rotor.  4) Inspection of stator and rotor components and parts.   5) Inspection of mechanical parts such as bearings, fans blades, etc.   6) Inspection of generator circuit breaker, control panel and voltage transformers.  7) Inspection of generator neutral earthing system.  8) Generator cooler leak test.  9) Electrical tests for the rotor and stator.   a.

Ref. Annexure 4c for detailed NICO reports.      53        CHAPTER 6: SOLAR FIELD 6.1 General Since the entire solar field would be isolated for the major outage, here was the opportunity to replace and repair many critical components in the solar field that would require a long outage period.    The strategy was to allocate one main contractor as a lump sum contract to implement all Solar Field activates including support services such as scaffolding, insulation, crane, inspections (including radiography & Dye Penetrant) as specified in the scope of works. One company identified as shown below.   1) Turbine Services and Solutions (Sanad Powertech) with their sub-contractor King City Technical Services: Responsible for all solar field activities.     Except for 768 level 3 boxes anticorrosion and painting, all solar field maintenance activities carried out including the opportunity work due to the extension of the outage caused by the steam turbine.      6.2 Scope of Works. Below are the scope planned for the outage.  1) 242 Damage absorber tube replacement. (Fig. 16)  2) 102 Ball joint replacement. (Fig. 15)  3) 384 Adjustment of ball joint double supports.

Figure 20: Hydraulic Cylinder replacement.    56           6.3 Contractors Involved The following are the main contractors assigned by Shams.  1) Turbine Services and Solutions (Sanad).  2) King City Technical Services.   6.4 Findings 1) Excessive foreign materials found, e.g. welding rods, stones, nuts and bolts, etc. after bonnet of the valve, R2JB_GH09910010AA501 was replaced. Please see Fig. 20.1    Figure 20.1: Debris found in the valve seat.   6.5 Recommendations 1) To check available spares inventory and order required amount well before the next minor and major outage.  2) Painting and anti-corrosion of Level 3 boxes required at the next possible opportunity.  3) HTF system to be cleaned during the next major outage.    Ref. Annexure 5 for detailed reports.    57        CHAPTER 7: IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS  7.1 Steam Turbine DCS upgrade The OEM (MAN) informed Shams that the Steam Turbine Distributed Control System would be obsolete after the year 2020 and recommended to have the system upgraded. MAN then implemented this during the outage. The current Steam Turbine DCS upgrade has a validity of 10 years.    Ref. Annexure 3 for detailed MAN outage report.    Lead Contractor: MAN Energy Solutions.   7.2 Air Cooled Condenser Cable modifications. The cable route for ACC Fan motors modified from underground route to overhead road crossing through cable tray rack. The project involved erection of new structure, installation of cable trays, cable pulling, and installation of junction panels, cable termination and testing.    The project executed in two stages: Pre-outage and Outage works. All civil, foundation and structural works carried out before Outage and cable pulling, termination and testing done within outage period. One set of spare cables were also pulled from MCC to ACC top platform.    After Cable termination, the cables were tested to ensure continuity, insulation and correct phase sequence. Each fan motors were started to confirm correct direction of rotation.    After few days of keeping the fans in service, there were failures observed on some terminal blocks due to overheating. All similar terminal block types were replaced with bus-bar type terminal and no overheating was observed.    Ref. Annexure 4 e for detailed reports.      58           Figure 18: New cable terminations.      Figure 19: New cable bridge.    Lead Contractor: Dolphin Oil Field Equipment Service.    59        7.3 Booster Heaters 1 & 2 design and installation of walkway platforms. Booster Heaters 1 & 2 had no access platform in which maintenance personnel could access in order to address any technical issues. Scaffolding was always used in order to create such access, which were often time consuming and costly. Therefore, permeant platforms designed and installed during the outage period to ensure safe and permeant access.     Figure 20: Booster Heater 1 & 2 permeant platforms.    Lead Contractors: Al Emain Blacksmith Workshop & Aries Oil Field Services.    60        7.4 Booster Heaters 1 & 2 burner modifications and commissioning. During the outage, pilot burner of each Booster Heater was replaced by a new higher capacity continuously running pilot burner in order to function with lower steam flow requirement. This ooster Heaters without much reduction in temperature of the downstream header.     For the logic modifications, during the light-off sequence, rather than an automatic transfer from igniter operation to main burner operation, when the igniter brought into service the BMS must hold in minimum light-off positions. Following a ten-second delay, an option will provide  option would continue the already programmed transition sequence to main burner operation. After this transition, the system will release to modulate per current logic. A flame scanner signal must be maintained during all modes or otherwise the system should initiate a trip.  -Heaters, used in Booster Heaters and supply supper heated steam to the Steam Turbine more efficiently.    Lead Contractors: John Zink Company LLC & Siemens LLC.   7.5 HTF Heater  Alternative Communication Network Upgrade. Communication among seven Panel Logic Controllers (Siemens) of HTF-Heaters and Distrusted Control System established through another PLC (Schneider) which was causing slow and overloading of communication traffic and poor reliability of communication architecture. Therefore, a new Alternative Communication Network (A.C.N) installed would get  (Siemens).     During 2020 outage, one out of seven HTF-Heater PLC system directly connected to the new A.C.N and tested. The result confirmed its availability and reliability of this upgrade.  The remaining six HTF-Heaters A.C.N upgrade will be planned in subsequent outages based on budget and time available.    Lead Contractor: Valmet Seluloz Kagit ve Enerji Teknolojiler    61        7.6 Steam Turbine Oil System Varnish removal unit. Prior to the outage, the steam turbine lube oil analyzed and reported of high varnish particles however, there was no water content traceable. Therefore, three options for the steam turbine oil system considered by Shams.    Option 1: Replacement of ST lube oil = AED 595,000.  Option 2: Cleaning/Treatment of the ST lube oil by contractor = AED 70,000.  Option 3: Procure, install and commission a permanent Varnish removal unit, plus a 1 year service agreement = AED 99,550.    Management of change created for Option 3, planned and implemented during outage successfully as shown in Fig. 21.     Figure 21: New Lube oil varnish removal system    Lead Contractor: Hydrocarbon Solutions International LLC   7.7 Gas Reducing and Metering Station (GRMS) roof vents. Following an insurance audit, there was a recommendation to install Vents in the GRMS area, however this required the entire station to shut down and the outage was the perfect opportunity. This was planned and implemented successfully during the outage period as shown in Fig 22.    62             Figure 22: Installed GRMS Roof Vents.    Lead Contractor: Green Energy Solutions VEM LLC     7.8 HTF Main pump area Overhead crane commissioning and load test The overhead crane installed during the initial commissioning phase of the Shams plant was not load tested. During the major outage, this overhead crane was inspected, load tested and commissioned for the first time since. This proved useful in saving time and money to remove the Main HTF pump for overhauling and re-installation.     Lead contractor: NICO International.         63        7.9 Steam Turbine Sprinkler System modification. The steam turbine bearing assembly sprinkler system was partially obstructed by a lube oil pipe. This point was part of the insurers report recommendations to modify it in order to ensure a proper water distribution in case of fire. During the outage, the obstructed sprinkler head was modified through a MOC generated by HSE department.    Lead contractor: None. This was done in-house.     7.10 Main HTF pumps deluge and Steam turbine lube oil skid foam systems actual tests. Due to daily operations constraints, the main HTF pumps deluge and steam turbine lube oil foam suppressions systems have never been tested. During the outage these two systems were successfully tested by HSE team and normalized prior to plant start up.    Lead contractor: None. This was done in-house.                64       Prior to the outage there were lack of some documentations which affected the preparation  and execution of the outage. These documents shown below would have provided more  clarity if available.  Drawings  Procedures  Documentation must clearly specify in the RFQ during the preparation phase for the outage in  future. During review of bidding contractor companies, documentation requirements must be  evaluated.        8.1 Documentation     1) Drawings with part number identifications.  2) Drawings required to generate lift plans prior to outage.   Insulation procedure plus technical specifications.  2) Commissioning procedures.  3) Turbine inspection protocols.  4) Loop and function check protocols.  5) Protection test procedure and protocols.  Reporting (during and after outage)  1) Detailed faultfinding report.  2) Detailed outage report.  a. As found readings.  b. Final settings.  c. Spare parts consumed.  d. Recommendations.     Lesson Learnt            CHAPTER 8: LESSONS LEARNT 1) Antonio.Antonuccio 2021-02-11 12:09:42 -------------------------------------------- What about use of Ai2 Asset Integrity Platform?   65        8.2 Contingency Calculation During the budget preparation phase for the major outage only 7% of the total outage budget     was considered with the assumption that there would be no major findings. The budget did  not account for the refurbishment cost of components and under estimation of the DCS upgrade that ended up more expensive.    Lesson Learnt  Future major outage contingency amount should be calculated based on the actual expenses records of the major outage 2020.     8.3 Outage Duration The outage duration based upon the assumption that the steam turbine rotor replaced with new and no major findings anticipated, following this, a 24-day schedule was prepared. However, during the outage the actual situation was very different, the technical findings were much more than expected and therefore critical path shifted to repair of these technical findings, causing the extension of the outage.    Lesson Learnt  Future major outage contingency amount should be calculated based on the actual expenses records of the major outage 2020.     8.4 Waste Management The outage activities have generated a huge amount of waste that has accumulated in the waste area. The accumulated waste was found not properly segregated mostly by the contractors where several incompatible wastes have been found in the same bins. Moreover, some waste was simply dumped on bare soil due to lack of waste bins.    Lesson learnt: For future outages, waste management aspect shall be clearly discussed with contractors in addition to provision of sufficient waste bins for proper segregation and disposal.    Antonio.Antonuccio 2021-02-11 12:13:17 -------------------------------------------- don't understand   66           9.1 Actual vs Budget Overview For the planned outage in March 2020 the overall budget was created as shown in table 1.  1) GL 591240 Major outage 2020: Budget amount for all the planned works executed during major outage.  2) GL 600112 Contingency / Extra work: To account for any unforeseen situations only 7% of the overall outage budget considered.    Table 1: Post Outage Budget overview (Estimated Cost vs. Budget)       Expected overrun of AED 6.33m was initially estimated. The estimation was done on a worst case scenario which was presented and approved by the Board.    * Estimated Costs were approximated based on existing contracts.  ^ Budget amount does not include AED 2.25m against Rotor Refurbishment. This activity is planned for 2021  CHAPTER 9: OUTAGE COST ANALYSIS   67       9.2 Reasons for Budget Over-run  Table 2: Post Outage Budget overview (Actual Cost vs. Budget)     * Feed Water Pump overhaul being part of the Major Overhaul scope, was done by the contractor initially. However, after the overhaul the results were not satisfactory and pump was found to be under performing. Subsequently, the full overhaul was successfully performed by the OEM. The related additional cost has been capitalized as part of the Major Overhaul.      ^ Budgeted amount does not include AED 2.25m against Rotor Refurbishment. This activity is planned for 2021          68        The below table shows the breakdown of four major areas of the outage works.  Table 2: Major outage 2020 breakdown   Areas  Budget  Approx. Actuals  Difference  Steam Turbine  AED 6,571,630  AED 8,296,135  -AED 1,724,505  Generator  AED 111,177  AED 520,000  -AED 408,823  Power Block  AED 6,472,978  AED 6,405,326  AED 67,652  Support Services  AED 680,000  AED 520,762  AED 159,238  TOTAL  AED 13,835,786  AED 15,742,223  -AED 1,906,438    The reasons for Steam Turbine over spend was due to the following.  1) MAN supervision personnel increased from three to five persons. Following meetings with MAN prior to the outage, they informed Shams that having only three persons would mean an advisory role in which the MAN personnel would only advise rather than supervise and take responsibility for the functionality and time schedule.  2) Steam Turbine DCS upgrade cost was much more than initially anticipated.     The reasons for the Generator over spend was due to the following.  1) Initial scope planned for the generator was a minor inspection, however due the technical issues on the generator bearing, shaft (vibrations) and stator windings (temperature) the scope updated to major inspection.  2) It is making financial sense to synchronize the generator major outage with the steam turbine major outage, the duration for both are approximately the same.  3) This change in scope had no impact on outage duration but the cost increased as shown in the table 2 above.     9.3 Contingency / Extra Works. The extra work on the Steam Turbine consisted of the following.  1) Procurement of raw materials.  2) Fabrication of material spares.  3) Machining of ST components.  4) Additional tools and equipment due to findings such as the drilling machine.    69        5) Extension of MAN personnel due to findings and turning gear incident.  6) Extension of Turbine Services and Solutions (Sanad) labor due to turning gear incident.   The extra work on the Generator consisted of the following.  1) Fabrication of tools such as the 5.4Ton turfer with 20 meter wire to pull the generator rotor.   2) Refurbishment of parts like the Drive End bearing.  3) Extended stay of BRUSH engineer due to travel restrictions caused from the COVID  19 pandemic.  The extra work on the Power Block consisted of the following.  1) Various repair activities following inspection and testing.  2) Additional activities due to extension of the outage.  3) Labor supply extension.    The HP piping supports was a major finding during the Steam Turbine outage. This required specialist personnel to survey and recommend corrective actions and hence the extra labor, support services and materials/parts were required.    70        ANNEXURES  Annexure 1: MAN Steam Turbine findings report.
