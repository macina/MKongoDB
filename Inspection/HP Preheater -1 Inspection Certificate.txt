Periodical inspection records since Oct2014 are available.   4.0. Scope of Inspection  4.1Visual Inspection 4.2 Eddy Current 4.3 Ultrasonic Thickness survey  4.4 Dye- penetrant  5.4 Borescope inspection    5.0. Conditions Found   5.1. External (Shell side)  5.1.1 All painting and insulation found intact without any evidence of painting peel off or     blistering and no evidence of any damage for insulation or insulation cover aluminum     sheet.  5.1.2 All ladders, stairways and handrails found in satisfactory condition.  5.1.3 All concrete support found in satisfactory condition without evidence of cracking or     spalling.   5.1.4 All external piping insulation found in satisfactory condition.  5.1.5 All earthling lugs found in satisfactory condition.   5.2. Internal (Tube side)  5.2.1 All tubes as could be seen internal surfaces found satisfactory without evidence of severe     corrosion, apart from one tube previously plugged upon pulling it out for further metallurgical   investigation on year 2015.  5.2.2 All tube to tube sheet welds found satisfactory.  5.2.3 All surfaces and welds of channel and pass partition found satisfactory.   5.2.4 All internal surface as could be seen of connected piping to channel found satisfactory.             6.0 NDT     6.1 Ultrasonic thickness survey            Ultrasonic thickness measurement was carried out on accessible locations of channel                        found satisfactory. See attached thickness measurement report.                                              6.2 Dye - Penetrant test                Dye - Penetrant test was carried out on tube to tube sheet welds                                 found satisfactory. See attached thickness measurement report.                      6.3 Eddy Current test                          Eddy current test was carried out on 466 tubes as sample, results was not clear due to high            amplitude noises caused by well know inter-granular corrosion created during tube fabrication           (see attached integrity review report dated December 2017 for more details).                                               6.4 Borescope Inspection                       6.1 Due to presence of inter-granular corrosion damage mechanism in the tubes, a part of            chromium content in stainless steel was depleted in some locations, these locations behave like        carbon steel. As eddy current technique not suitable for testing carbon steel material, a tube         condition cannot be accurately defined using eddy current technique. Also, IRIS suitable          probe for this diameter of tubes not available in the market. So, a nine tubes were selected          for borescope internal visual inspection to visually define internal condition of tubes, all          found no visual defects. Meanwhile, borescope inspection from shell side result was            satisfactory (see attached videos and photos).

Tubes Inspected:  466 Nos. Maximum defect 49% Comments:  Tubes were found as fairly cleaned condition. Most of the tubes are exhibiting noisy signals suspected the presence of ferromagnetic contents in the tube material. All of these tube data are appeared as ID Corrosion in ECT analysis whereas which could not be relevant if any changes occurred on electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability of the material under test. More over there is chances to miss real defect indications if any exist within the noisy signals region.   9 tubes were selected for boroscopy and found no visual defects in ID surface. ECT data images are attached in this report. Some tubes in the bottom row are showing the signs of OD Pitting.
