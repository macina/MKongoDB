SUMMARY The above pressure vessel was taken off line, isolated, opened, vented & cleaned for major external & internal inspections.   2.0. SUBJECT 2.1. This is a horizontal, cylindrical, ASTM A-516 Gr.60 tank with one inlet and outlet of condensate water.   Size 3.3X10.42 m Design pressure 3 barg Design temperature +50 c Operation pressure 65 mbarg Operation temperature 40c Fluid characteristics @ 141 c  Flanges  1A3 Piping 1A3 Shell minimum thickness 1.6mm corrosion allowance  Head minimum thickness 1.6mm corrosion allowance       ............................................................................................................................................. The above equipment is/ is not considered suitable for further service under the present operating conditions  NEXT MAJOR INSPECTION DUE :January 2024  INSPECTED:   Osman Ismail                               ENDORSEMENT:      48      MONTHS         REVIEWED:    Ali AL Masabai                            Page 2 of 4  3.0 HISTORY This tank was commissioned in 2013. Periodical inspection records since Oct2014 are available.   4.0. SCOPE OF INSPECTION 4.1 Visual inspection. 4.2 Ultrasonic thickness measurement.  5.0. CONDITIONS FOUND 5.1. External  5.1.1 All painting and insulation found intact without any evidence of painting peel off or blistering and no evidence of any damage for insulation or insulation cover aluminum sheet. 5.1.2 All ladders, stairways and handrails found in satisfactory condition. 5.1.3 All concrete support found in satisfactory condition without evidence of cracking or spalling.  5.1.4 All external piping insulation found in satisfactory condition. 5.1.5 All earthling lugs found in satisfactory condition.  5.2. Internal  5.2.1 All internals found in satisfactory condition without evidence of fallen down, damage or corrosion. 5.2.2 All internal surfaces of shell and heads found in satisfactory condition, apart from normal carbon steel very thin hydroxide layer. 5.2.3 All welds of shell and heads found in satisfactory condition without evidence of heavy 5.2.4 All internal surfaces of connected nozzles and manway found in satisfactory condition            accept manhole visual inspection revealed noticeable pit surrounded by some shallow wide   pits. This is most probably due to oxygen corrosion. 5.2.5 All thermos wells found in satisfactory condition.               8.1. Ultrasonic Testing        - Ultrasonic thickness measurement was carried out on the internal shell courses and heads                         found satisfactory. See attached thickness measurement report.  6.0. Recommendation                          - Review BFW deaerating process to assure absence of oxygen and mitigate any oxygen                  further corrosion.   10.
