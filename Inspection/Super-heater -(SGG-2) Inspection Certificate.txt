The above equipment is/ is not considered suitable for further service under the present operating conditions  NEXT MAJOR INSPECTION DUE : March 2024  INSPECTED:   Osman Ismail                              ENDORSEMENT:   48     MONTHS         REVIEWED:    Ali Al Masabai                           Page 2 of 5     3.0 History  This Super-heater - (SGG-2) was commissioned in 2013. Periodical inspection records since Oct2014 are available.   4.0. Scope of Inspection  4.1Visual Inspection 4.2 Remote field Eddy Current (RFT) 4.3 Ultrasonic Thickness survey  4.4 Dye- penetrant  5.4 Borescope inspection   5.0. CONDITIONS FOUND  5.1. External (Shell side) 5.1.1 All painting and insulation found intact without any evidence of painting peel off or     blistering and no evidence of any damage for insulation or insulation cover aluminum     sheet. 5.1.2 All ladders, stairways and handrails found in satisfactory condition. 5.1.3 All concrete support found in satisfactory condition without evidence of cracking or     spalling.  5.1.4 All external piping insulation found in satisfactory condition. 5.1.5 All earthling lugs found in satisfactory condition.  5.2. Internal (Tube side)  5.2.1 All tubes as could see internal surfaces found satisfactory condition without evidence of   corrosion, apart from a considerable amounts of deposits which have cleaned by high pressure hydro jetting. 5.2.2 All tube to tube sheet welds found in satisfactory condition. 5.2.3 Diaphragm was cut out for tube inspection access and welded back and dye-penetrant tested   successfully.  5.2.4 Scattered pitting (oxygen corrosion) were found in the lower part of channel (6:00 oclock   position). Evaluation was carried out according to API 510, Paragraph 7.4.3 found      acceptable, see attached pitting evaluation report.        6.0 NDT    6.1 Ultrasonic thickness survey            Ultrasonic thickness measurement was carried out on accessible locations of channel                       found satisfactory. See attached thickness measurement report.                                            6.2 Dye  Penetrant test                Dye  Penetrant test was carried out on tube to tube sheet welds and new welds of diaphragm                    all found satisfactory. See attached thickness measurement report.                      Page 3 of 5        6.3 Remote field Eddy Current test (RFT)                              Eddy current test was carried out on 118 tubes as sample, results was satisfactory as         indicated in below table. More details in the attached RFT report.                                   6.4 borescope Inspection                         It was done internally from tube side end and externally of tubes from shell side end. It revealed      a considerable amount of deposit inside tubes, while outside was satisfactory. After hydro       jetting deposits was less but not removed completely, (see attached videos and photos)     6.7 Chemical Analysis                        Chemical analysis was carried out through third party called GEO CHEM MIDDLE EAST,       results was normal.   7.0. Recommendations          Super-heater- (SSG-2) to be open for inspection after four years as per SHAMS code of      practice.  8.0 Inspection Grade and Interval  In accordance with the latest revision of SHAMS Code of Practice, this Super-Heater  (SGG-2) was endorsed for 48 months under class 2, for next Major Inspection.
