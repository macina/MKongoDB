Summary       The above header was taken off line, and insulation stripped down at flow meter and some locations    adjacent to turbine for major external inspections. A  cut and    re-welding as well as readjusting affected supports were carried out successfully. Flow meter follow     up inspection carried out successfully.    2.0. Subject    2.1.

The above equipment is/ is not considered suitable for further service under the present operating conditions  Next Major Inspection date : Jan 2024  Inspected:   Osman Ismail                              Endorsement:      48      Months            Reviewed:    Ali Al Masabai                           Page 2 of 3   3.0 History  This header is connecting two booster heaters to turbine, comprising many different components like flow meter, steam traps, supports (normal, snippers and spring types). Pipe diameters ranges   is ASTM 335 Gr P91. It was commissioned in 2013 and pavailable.   On 21/02/2017 it was subjected to hammering incident due to condensate accumulation in the line during lined up in the morning. This led to header dislocation at several locations and clashing with adjacent piping, in addition to small diameter associated piping was heavily affected.    On 17.04.2017 it was inspected by REX subsidiary of GIS  MIC, outcome available in their attached report.  On January outage 2018 it was comprehensively inspected to get piping integrity updated data for further stress analysis. Inspection scope included phased array of most affected welding, laser inspection of most affected welding elbow. Outcome was mostly satisfactory.   On April 2018 Flow meter pipe was reported leak from welding of flow meter nozzle to main pipe. Repairing was very difficult due to utilizing of different materials (SS 316 L for Nozzle) and (A 335 P91 for main pipe) and (tapering material Nickle base alloy). Due to repeated cracks during repair welding process it take more than 4 weeks and plant was completely shut down. Based on manufacturer recommendation nozzle material was changed to be same of main pipe material.  On January 2019 a new flow material with new design was installed.  On March 2020 a follow up inspection was carried out and outcome was satisfactory.    4.0. Scope of Inspection       4.1 Visual inspection.      4.2 Phased Array.      4.3 Replica testing  5.0. Conditions Found       5.1 During turbine overall a diameter connected spool to turbine was cut for turbine dismantling,     this led to unbalance of all steam header adjacent piping parts to turbine particularly at its supports.       So, all supports readjusted based on new position of header after welding it back to turbine inlet,          details of readjusted support attached.       5.2 New welding of 14 was carried out by HIDROMONTAZA        contractor, it was welded as per specified welding procedure, heat treated and phased array         inspected successfully.        5.3 While checking materials of the header using PMI instrument a deviation of material specification    found, according it was decided to check all header different parts. Further testing confirmed      difference in header parts materials, some of it showed low grade materials, report attached.  6.0. Recommendations          6.1 It is highly recommended to check suitability of low grade materials of the header with current         operating and design conditions.           6.2 Inspect flow meter pipe within main header inspection program after 4 years as per            SHAMS Code of Practice.    Page 3 of 3   10. Inspection Grade and Interval  In accordance with the latest revision of SHAMS Code of Practice, this header was endorsed for 48 months for next Major Inspection.
