SUMMARY The above pressure vessel was taken off line, isolated, opened, vented & cleaned for major external & internal inspections.   2.0. SUBJECT 2.1. This is a horizontal, cylindrical, carbon steel tank with one inlet from super heater and 6 outlets connected to steam header and 8 down comers from both sides of drum.   Size  Design pressure 119.5 bar-g Design temperature 324 c Operation pressure 90bar-g Operation temperature 310 c maximum Fluid characteristics @ 141 c  Flanges  A314 Piping A314 Shell thickness  Head thickness        ............................................................................................................................................. The above equipment is/ is not considered suitable for further service under the present operating conditions  NEXT MAJOR INSPECTION DUE : January 2023   INSPECTED:   Osman Ismail                                ENDORSEMENT:    48   MONTHS          REVIEWED:    Ali Al Masabai                          Page 2 of 4   3.0 HISTORY  This tank was commissioned in 2013. Periodical inspection records since Oct2014 are available.   4.0. SCOPE OF INSPECTION  4.1 Visual inspection. 4.2 Ultrasonic thickness measurement  5.0. CONDITIONS FOUND  5.1. External  5.1.1 All insulation found intact without any evidence of any damage for insulation or insulation cover aluminum sheet. 5.1.3 All ladders, stairways and handrails found in satisfactory condition. 5.1.4 All concrete support found in satisfactory condition without evidence of cracking or spalling. 5.1.5 All grounding found in place  5.2. Internal  5.2.1 All internals found in satisfactory condition without evidence of fallen down, damage or       corrosion. It found with black magnetite layer in the lower half of the drum apart from         hematite layer in the upper half of the drum 5.2.2 All internal surfaces of shell and heads found in satisfactory condition with black magnetite   layer in the lower half of the drum apart from hematite layer in the upper half of the drum 5.2.3 All welds of shell and heads found in satisfactory condition without evidence of heavy. 5.2.4 All internal surfaces of connected nozzles and manway found in satisfactory condition without evidence of sever corrosion. 5.2.5 All thermos wells found in satisfactory condition 5.2.6 Manways, nozzle, cover and lock bolts found in satisfactory condition. 5.2.7 There are some iron oxide deposits scattered on upper half of the drum.                 5.8.1. Ultrasonic Testing  Ultrasonic thickness measurement was carried out on the internal shell courses and heads found satisfactory. Thickness measurement report available.  6.0 Conclusion   -    Hematite (Fe2O3) is favored at high oxygen levels can be red and is a binding agent and   tends to hold over materials in deposition. This is an indication of active corrosion     occurring within the boiler/feed system  - Magnetite (Fe3O4) a smooth black tenacious, dense magnetite layer normally grows on boiler waterside surfaces. Taken to indicate good corrosion protection as it forms in low oxygen levels and is susceptible to acidic attack    Page 3 of 4   7.0. RECOMMENDATIONS      - Review BFW deaerating process to assure absence of oxygen and mitigate                                          any oxygen further corrosion.     - It is recommended to open steam drum -1 after 4 years as per SHAMS Code of Practice.  8. INSPECTION GRADE AND INTERVAL In accordance with the latest revision of SHAMS Code of Practice, this Steam Drum was endorsed for 48 months for next Major Inspection.   FREQUENCY    : 48 MONTHS. ENDORSEMENT   : 48 MONTHS, Next Major Insp. due  : March, 2023   Photos       Grounding of Steam drum External conditions     Page 4 of 4        Shell surfaces ,welds and Internals    Manways
