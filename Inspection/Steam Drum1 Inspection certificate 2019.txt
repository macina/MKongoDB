The above equipment is/ is not considered suitable for further service under the present operating conditions  NEXT MAJOR INSPECTION DUE : January 2023   INSPECTED:   Osman Ismail                                ENDORSEMENT:    48   MONTHS          REVIEWED:    Ali Al Masabai                           Page 2 of 5   3.0 History  This tank was commissioned in 2013. Periodical inspection records since Oct2014 are available.   4.0. Scope of Inspection  4.1 Visual inspection. 4.2 Ultrasonic thickness measurement  5.0. Conditions Found  5.1. External  5.1.1 All insulation found intact without any evidence of any damage for insulation or insulation       cover aluminum sheet. 5.1.3 All ladders, stairways and handrails found in satisfactory condition. 5.1.4 All concrete support found in satisfactory condition without evidence of cracking or spalling. 5.1.5 All grounding found in place  5.2. Internal  5.2.1 All internals found in satisfactory condition without evidence of fallen down, damage or    corrosion. It found with black magnetite layer in the lower half of the drum apart from       hematite layer in the upper half of the drum 5.2.2 All internal surfaces of shell and heads found in satisfactory condition with black magnetite  layer in the lower half of the drum apart from hematite layer in the upper half of the drum . 5.2.3 All welds of shell and heads found in satisfactory condition without evidence of corrosion. 5.2.4 All internal surfaces of connected nozzles and manway found in satisfactory condition     without evidence of sever corrosion. 5.2.5 All thermos wells found in satisfactory condition 5.2.6 Manways, nozzle, cover and lock bolts found in satisfactory condition. 5.2.7 There are some iron oxide deposits scattered on upper half of the drum.                 5.8.1. Ultrasonic Testing  Ultrasonic thickness measurement was carried out on the internal shell courses and heads surfaces found satisfactory. Thickness measurement report available.   6.0 Conclusion   -    Hematite (Fe2O3) is favored at high oxygen levels can be red and is a binding agent and tends    to hold over materials in deposition. This is an indication of active corrosion occurring within    the boiler/feed system  - Magnetite (Fe3O4) a smooth black tenacious, dense magnetite layer normally grows on boiler waterside surfaces. Taken to indicate good corrosion protection as it forms in low oxygen levels and is susceptible to acidic attack     7.0. Recommendations      - Review BFW deaerating process to assure absence of oxygen and mitigate                                          any oxygen further corrosion.     - It is recommended to open steam drum -1 after 4 years as per SHAMS Code of Practice.
