Periodical inspection records since Oct2014 are available.   4.0. Scope of Inspection  4.1Visual Inspection 4.2 Eddy Current 4.3 Ultrasonic Thickness survey  4.4 Dye- penetrant  5.4 Borescope inspection    5.0. Conditions Found   5.1. External (Shell side)  5.1.1 All painting and insulation found intact without any evidence of painting peel off or     blistering and no evidence of any damage for insulation or insulation cover aluminum     sheet.  5.1.2 All ladders, stairways and handrails found in satisfactory condition.  5.1.3 All concrete support found in satisfactory condition without evidence of cracking or     spalling.   5.1.4 All external piping insulation found in satisfactory condition.  5.1.5 All earthling lugs found in satisfactory condition.   5.2. Internal (Tube side)  5.2.1 All tubes as could be seen internal surfaces found satisfactory without evidence of severe     corrosion.   5.2.2 All tube to tube sheet welds found satisfactory.  5.2.3 All surfaces and welds of channel and pass partition found satisfactory.   5.2.4 All internal surface as could be seen of connected piping to channel found satisfactory.             6.0 NDT     6.1 Ultrasonic thickness survey            Ultrasonic thickness measurement was carried out on accessible locations of channel                        found satisfactory with average thickness 66.00 mm. See attached thickness measurement report.                                              6.2 Dye - Penetrant test                Dye - Penetrant test was carried out on tube to tube sheet welds                                 found satisfactory. See attached thickness measurement report.                      6.3 Eddy Current test                          Eddy current test was carried out on 18 tubes as sample, results was not clear due to high            amplitude noises caused by well know inter-granular corrosion created during tube fabrication           (see attached integrity review report dated December 2017 for more details).                                               6.4 Borescope Inspection                       6.1 Due to presence of inter-granular corrosion damage mechanism in the tubes, a part of            chromium content in stainless steel was depleted in some locations, these locations behave like        carbon steel. As eddy current technique not suitable for testing carbon steel material, a tube         condition cannot be accurately defined using eddy current technique. Also, IRIS suitable          probe for this diameter of tubes not available in the market. So, a five tubes were selected          for borescope internal visual inspection to visually define internal condition of tubes, all          found no visual defects, one of them was eddy current tested. Meanwhile, borescope inspection from       shell side result was satisfactory (see attached videos and photos).
