Internal (Tube side)  5.2.1 All tubes as could see internal surfaces found satisfactory condition without evidence of   corrosion, apart from a considerable amounts of deposits which have cleaned by high pressure hydro jetting. 5.2.2 All tube to tube sheet welds found in satisfactory condition. 5.2.3 Diaphragm was cut out for tube inspection access and welded back successfully.          6.0 NDT    6.1 Ultrasonic thickness survey            Ultrasonic thickness measurement was carried out on accessible locations of channel                       found satisfactory. See attached thickness measurement report.                                            6.2 Dye  Penetrant test                 Dye  Penetrant test was carried out on tube to tube sheet welds and new welds of diaphragm                    all found satisfactory. See attached thickness measurement report.                         Page 3 of 4     6.3 Remote field Eddy Current test (RFT)                              Eddy current test was carried out on 116 tubes as sample, results was satisfactory as         indicated in below table. More details in the attached RFT report.                                                        6.4 borescope Inspection                         It was done internally from tube side end and externally of tubes from shell side end. It revealed      a considerable amount of deposit inside tubes, while outside was satisfactory. After hydro       jetting deposits was less but not removed completely, (see attached videos and photos)     6.7 Chemical Analysis                        Chemical analysis was carried out through third party called GEO CHEM MIDDLE EAST,       results was normal except manganese oxide was little bit high , (chemical analysis report        attached).  7.0. Recommendations          Pre-heater  (SSG-2) to be open for inspection after four years as per SHAMS code of practice.  8.0 Inspection Grade and Interval  In accordance with the latest revision of SHAMS Code of Practice, this Pre-Heater  (SGG-2) was endorsed for 48 months under class 2, for next Major Inspection.

All measurement was calculated from the nominal wall thickness.                Scanning was carried out from the fixed end Rows were numbered from Top to Bottom Columns were numbered from Left to Right  6.0 DISCUSSION / RESULTS  Cleaning of the tubes is not good enough for RFET Inspection.  No major indications found during the scanning  All the tubes are in good condition  Tubes were classified as follows:-     Classifications Total No Defects Detected 116 0.1% - 10% Volume Loss 0 10%- 20% Volume Loss 0 20%- 30% Volume Loss 0 30%- 40% Volume Loss 0 40.0%- 50% Volume Loss 0 50.0 +Volume Loss 0 Restricted 0 Obstructed 0 Plugged 0 REMOTE FIELD EDDY CURENT INSPECTION REPORT (RFET)  PREHEATER 2 R1HAC12-BC010  REPORT NO:-NA-  Page 3 of 6 7.0  TUBE CONDITION DURING INSPECTION                                                       Tube Inspection Results  NDD:- No Defect Detected RST:- Restricted OBS:-Obstructed PLG:-Plugged WLL:- WALL LOSS COR:- CORROSION  SL NO Row  Col.
