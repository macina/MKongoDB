Tubes Inspected:  18 Nos. Maximum defect 40% Comments:  Tubes were found as fairly cleaned condition. Most of the tubes are exhibiting noisy signals suspected the presence of ferromagnetic contents in the tube material. All of these tube data are appeared as ID Corrosion in ECT analysis whereas which could not be relevant if any changes occurred on electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability of the material under test. More over there is chances to miss real defect indications if any exist within the noisy signals region.   4 tubes were selected for boroscopy and found no visual defects in ID surface.
